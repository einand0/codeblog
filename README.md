# codeblog

An application developed with ReactJs + NodeJs + MongoDB. It's basically a blog post where you can add posts, edit them, remove and also I worked with authentication.

This website was developed for me to practice my skills in Javascript, NodeJS, MongoDB, ReactJS and the MVC architecture.
